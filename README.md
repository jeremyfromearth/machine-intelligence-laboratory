# Machine Intelligence Laboratory
A repo for machine learning demos, visualizations and research. Unless otherwise specified all algorithms and techniques are hand-rolled using NumPy, SciPy and Pandas. No ML libraries are being implemented and likewise, this is not an ML library. That said, I've tried to be consistent in the api of the learning algorithms. All models have a learn method which accepts a Pandas `DataFrame` as it's first argument. Though, it should be noted that where possible, the algorithms will generally use NumPy arrays interally because they are generally faster.
