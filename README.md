A repo for machine learning demos, visualizations and research. Unless otherwise specified alll algorithms and techniques are hand-rolled using NumPy, SciPy and Pandas. No ML libraries are being implemented and likewise, this is not an ML library.

Generally, data is represented and transformed in Pandas DataFrames, while ML algorithms operate on NumPy Arrays.
