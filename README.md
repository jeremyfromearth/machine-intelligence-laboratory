# M.L. Workshop

Welcome to my Machine Learning and Data Science workshop.

Unless otherwise indicated, the algorithms and code in this repo are interpertations of well known M.L. techniques, that I've developed from scratch. In most cases, the approaches presented here are sometimes naive, in that clarity and readability are prioritized over performance. While I'm interested in popular Python M.L. libraries like ScikitLearn, PyTorch and TensorFlow, the code in this repo uses very few third party libs. For the most part Pandas, Numpy & SciPy are the only dependencies.
