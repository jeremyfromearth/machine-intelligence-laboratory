# M.L. Workshop

Welcome to my Machine Learning and Data Science workshop.

Unless otherwise indicated, the algorithms and code presented here are interpertations of well known M.L. techniques developed from scratch. When implementing a given feature I'll typically consult a variety of resources and test using something easily interpretable. The approaches presented here are sometimes naive in that clarity and readability are prioritized over performance. This is not always the case though. Occasionally, I can't resist optimizing. While I'm interested in popular Python M.L. libraries like ScikitLearn, PyTorch and TensorFlow, the code in this repo uses very few third party libs. For the most part, only Pandas, Numpy & SciPy are the only dependencies.
